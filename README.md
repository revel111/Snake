# Snake
Game "Snake" on Java. Game was created using libraries: Java swing, awt. The map is based on custom AbstractTableModel and it is drawn using DefaultCellRenderer. Classical gameplay without any changes. After end of the game user write his/her nickname and after this user can find his result in the high scores table.
P.S. This project is basically the same, as my project with Pacman, i just wanted to implement the gameplay of this game and to repeat how things work.
